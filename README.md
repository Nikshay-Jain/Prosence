### Facial Recognition and automatic attendance (with time) recorder.
New faces can be added by adding by placing an image of the person named as his name itself simply.
This project uses OpenCV along with face_recognition (coded over dlib and cmake) to recognise faces.
The presence is marked in Presence.csv file by that code itself along with the time of recognition.
